## üîπ Multi-Variant Analysis

VarXOmics supports **multi-variant analysis** for **small variants (SNPs & INDELs)**, **copy number variants (CNVs)**, and **structural variants (SVs)**.  
This module allows users to upload VCF files, configure advanced filtering parameters, and perform variant interpretation in a structured and reproducible manner.

### 1. Input Data

- From the **Home** page, choose **‚ÄúMulti Variant‚Äù**.  
- Drop and upload a **VCF file**.  
- Click **Run** to proceed to the variant filtering configuration window.

### 2. Variant Filtering Settings

After uploading the VCF, a configuration panel titled **‚ÄúMulti-Variant Analysis Settings‚Äù** will appear.  
This panel allows fine-tuning of variant filtration and prioritization parameters.


### üß© Sample Filters

| Setting | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Reference Genome** | Select the genome build used for alignment ‚Äî **GRCh37** or **GRCh38**. |
| **Gender** | Choose the biological sex of the sample (**Male**, **Female**, or **Unknown**) for filtering X/Y-linked variants. |
| **Only PASS Variants** | When set to **Yes**, filters out non-PASS variants from the VCF. |
| **Inheritance Pattern** | Specify the expected mode of inheritance (**Dominant**, **Recessive**, **Compound Heterozygous**, or **Any pattern**). |
| **HPO Terms (CSV)** | Provide one or multiple **HPO IDs** (comma-separated) to integrate phenotype-based filtering, e.g. `HP:0001250,HP:0000707`. |

### üåç Allele Frequency Filters

| Setting | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **AF ClinVar** | Sets a frequency cap for ClinVar-derived evidence. Variants above this threshold are excluded. |
| **AF (Predicted variants)** | Defines the **allele frequency cutoff** for predicted variants (e.g., 0.05). Lower thresholds retain rarer variants. |

### ü§ñ Predictive Scores

| Score | Description | Typical Cutoff |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **ADA** | ADA score for splicing impact prediction. | 0.6 |
| **RF** | Random Forest model score for splicing variant prediction. | 0.6 |
| **REVEL** | REVEL score for missense variant pathogenicity prediction. | 0.75 |

### üß¨ SpliceAI Thresholds

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Acceptor Loss (AL)** | Minimum threshold for acceptor site loss prediction. | 0.5 |
| **Acceptor Gain (AG)** | Minimum threshold for acceptor site gain prediction. | 0.5 |
| **Donor Loss (DL)** | Minimum threshold for donor site loss prediction. | 0.5 |
| **Donor Gain (DG)** | Minimum threshold for donor site gain prediction. | 0.5 |

### üßÆ BayesDel Scores

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **BayesDel (with AF)** | Bayesian deleteriousness score integrating allele frequency. | 0.069 |
| **BayesDel (no AF)** | Bayesian deleteriousness score excluding frequency adjustment. | -0.057 |

> These thresholds align with backend default values for consistent filtering.


### üßæ Classification Filters

#### **AlphaMissense (AM) Classification**
Select which **ACMG/AMP pathogenicity tiers** to retain in the analysis:
- Pathogenic  
- Likely Pathogenic  
- Ambiguous  
- Benign  

#### **AlphaMissense (AM) Pathogenicity**
- Numerical cutoff representing aggregated pathogenicity evidence (e.g., 0.564).

#### **ClinVar Status**
Select ClinVar review statuses to include:
- Pathogenic  
- Likely Pathogenic  
- Uncertain Significance  
- Conflicting Classifications  
- Benign  
- Likely Benign  

#### **ACMG Classification**
Specify ACMG evidence tiers for filtering:
- Pathogenic  
- Likely Pathogenic  
- Uncertain Significance  
- Benign  
- Likely Benign  

### 3. Run Analysis

Once all filters are configured, click **Start Analysis** to execute the variant prioritization pipeline.  


### 4. Result Overview
VarXOmics processes and prioritizes all variants based on its integrated filtering and scoring strategy. The final results are divided into six major sections, each providing an in-depth view of the analysis outcome.
