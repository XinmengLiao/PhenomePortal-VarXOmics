## 🔹 Gene Query

VarXOmics supports **single-gene queries** by simply entering the official gene symbol.

### 1. Input Gene  
- From the **Home** page, choose **“Gene”**.  
- Enter the official gene symbol (e.g., `BRCA1`).  
- Click **Run** to proceed.

### 2. View Results  
Results are automatically displayed after data loading. Annotations and analyses are organized into four sections:

#### 🧪 Clinical Evidence
- Displays gene-related clinical evidence** from **ClinVar**, **ClinGen**, and **GenCC** databases.  
- Summarizes known gene–phenotype associations and related clinical interpretations.

#### 🍭 ClinVar Lollipop
- Visualizes all ClinVar-recorded variants for the queried gene as a lollipop plot.  
- Supports zooming and detailed inspection of protein alterations.  
- Plots can be exported in _PNG_ and _PDF_ formats.

#### 🔗 Network
- Illustrates biological interactions involving the queried gene, including:
  - ClinVar-associated variants
  - Protein–protein interactions (PPIs)
- The network is interactive: users can zoom or adjust edge weight to explore relationships.

#### 💊 xQTL & Gene–Drug Interactions
- Provides structured tables containing:
  - eQTL and pQTL associations  
  - Mendelian Randomization (MR) evidence  
  - Gene–drug interactions
