### Features:
1. Support both small variants (SNV, INDELs) and structural variants (SVs, CNVs).
2. Provide comprehensive variant annotation, including HGVSc, HGVSp, consequences on proteins, clinical evidence, global allele frequency, prediction scores.
3. Consolidate multi-omics data, including eQTL, pQTL, GWAS, MR and PGx datasets, to provide holistic insights into the diverse effects of genetic variants.
4. Enable functional interpretation through gene set enrichment analysis and uncovers interactions across different biological levels via network analysis.
5. The multi-omics evidence-based scoring system and the disease-causing variant scoring system facilitate the prioritization of potentially deleterious variants.
6. Generate downable visualizations and structured tabular data to facilate downstream analysis.
