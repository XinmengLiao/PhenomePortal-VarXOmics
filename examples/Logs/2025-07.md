### UI design for the home page
The structure looks overall really nice. I hope some functions could be added. 

![ALT TEXT](https://github.com/XinmengLiao/APMI-VarXOmics/blob/main/images/FirstPage.png)

0. change the background color to a lighter one since most of the figures have white background. 
1. Change the description to: Advanced web server for genomic data querying and variant prioritizing with multi-omics insights.
2. vcf file could only be the compressed `vcf.gz` file currently.
3. More filter options could be added. These filterations will be applied only for multiple variant anlaysis. \

   **Clinical Pathogenicity (multi-Selections)** \
       a) ClinVar Pathogenicity (6 options): Pathogenic, Likely pathogenic, Uncertain Significance, Conflicting classifications, Benign, Likely benign \
       b) ACMG Predicted Classification (5 options):  Pathogenic, Likely pathogenic, Uncertain Significance, Benign, Likely benign
       c) ACMG Pathogenicity: default display: 0.564

      **Allele Frequency (float)** \
      a) ClinVar variant: default display: 1 \
      b) Predicted variant: default display: 0.05 
      
      **Variant Deleteriouseness** \
      a) PolyPhen Score: default display: 0.05 \
      b) BayesDel Score (addAF): default display: 0.0692655 \
      c) BayesDel Score (noAF): default display: -0.0570105
      
      **Missense Impact** \
      a) AlphaMissense Classification (multi-selection, 3 options): Likely pathogenic, Uncertain Significance, Likely benign \
      b) AlphaMissense Score: default display: default display: 0.564 \
      c) REVEL Score: default display: default display: 0.75 \
      d) Ada Score: default display: 0.6 \
      e) Rf score: default display: 0.6
      
      **Splicing Impact** \
      a) Acceptor Gain :default display: 0.5 \
      b) Acceptor Loss: default display: 0.5 \
      c) Donor Gain: default display: 0.5 \
      d) Donor Loss: default display: 0.5 
   
   All these filterations will be passed to configuration files `Scripts/multivariant_config.yaml`

5. Descriptions change to:
    - Comprehensive variant annotation: Variants with xxxx details. 
    - Multi-omics insights: Easy searching of eQTL, pQTL, GWAS, MR, PGx information.
    - Diverse functions: Quick searching of relevant functional pathways and interactions through biological network.
    - Variant prioritizations: VarXOmics and Exomiser approaches for stratifying significant and disease-causing variants.
    - Easy data output: Easy output Publication-ready figures and tabular analysed data for simplifying downstream anlaysis. 

6. Add more options: \
   a) Reference genome version: GRCH37 or GRCH38 \
   b) 'PASS only' or not
   c) Gender: Male, Female, Unknown
   d) HPO IDs: (need to in format HP:xxxx)
