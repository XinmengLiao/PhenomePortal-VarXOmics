Muscle Volume	Athleticism	IL15RA	rs2228059	Muscle volume refers to the overall size of one's muscles, particularly skeletal muscles responsible for movement. These muscles are composed of bundles of muscle fibers within individual muscle cells. The augmentation of muscle volume is typically attributed to the enlargement of muscle cell size rather than an increase in the number of cells. Environmental factors, such as exercise, can impact muscle volume, and genetic factors play a role in determining both one's inherent muscle volume and how effectively muscles respond to training.	T/T>T/G	The rs2228059 CC genotype has been associated with typical muscle volume and typical baseline cortical bone volume in males, according to a study (PMID: 18514540
        
        
        
        ).The A-allele (CA,AA genotype) in rs2228059 was also reported associated with larger muscle volume but lower muscle quality in men (Pistilli et al., 2008).	Heterozygous
Endurance	Athleticism	SIRT1	rs41299232	An individualÕs endurance capacity is determined by many factors, including their muscle fibre typology, haemoglobin mass, mitochondrial biogenesis, maximal cardiac output, and maximal rate of oxygen consumption (VO2max), among others [118,119,120,121,122,123,124]. Indeed, there is evidence that these intermediate phenotypes have a substantial genetic influence, with literature indicating that genetic factors account for up to 70% of the variability in endurance-related traits [125]. Usually, genetic markers associated with endurance athlete status are determined by comparing allelic frequencies between endurance athletes (e.g., biathletes, road cyclists etc.) and controls.

Power	Athleticism	CRTAC1	rs2439823	Several characteristics are positively associated with power performance, including circulating levels of testosterone, percentage and cross-sectional area of fast-twitch muscle fibres, muscle mass and strength, body and calcaneus height, muscle fascicle length, and reaction time, among others [3,238,239,240,241,242,243,244]. The heritability of power-related phenotypes has been reported in the literature to range from approximately 49 to 86% in a range of phenotypes, including jumping ability [245,246]. Typically, genetic markers associated with power athlete status are determined by comparing allelic frequencies between power athletes (e.g., 100 m runners, shot putters, arm wrestlers, etc.) and untrained subjects.

Cilantro (Coriander) Preference	Sensory Perception	Intergenic	rs2741762	Coriandrum sativum is the plant responsible for producing both cilantro and coriander. Cilantro is typically harvested during the initial growth cycle before flowering, while coriander is harvested after the plant has blossomed and developed seeds. While some people enjoy the taste of cilantro, incorporating it into dishes like rice, burritos, and guacamole, others strongly dislike its flavor and aroma, often describing it as ""soapy.""

Heterozygous
Eye Color	Physical Appearance	TYR	rs1393350	Eye colors are determined by the variable pigmentation of the iris and the scattering of light by the iris. Individuals with a higher concentration of the dark pigment melanin tend to have darker eye colors, while those with a lower concentration generally have lighter-colored eyes. Light eye colors, such as blue, green, and hazel, are not produced by pigments but are mainly the result of the variable scattering of light by the iris.	G/G>G/A	Research conducted on individuals of European ancestry indicates that the rs1393350 AA genotype is linked to an increased likelihood of having blue eyes (PMID(s): 17952075, 23100201, 23986280, 20585627) while other genotypes are less likely to have blue eyes.	Heterozygous
Achilles Tendinopathy	Athleticism	MMP3	rs679620	Achilles tendinopathy is characterized by the degeneration of collagen in the tendons connecting calf muscles to heel bones, leading to pain, swelling, and stiffness during and after activities like walking. More strenuous pursuits, such as running and jumping, can exacerbate these symptoms. The condition is often attributed to persistent overuse of the tendon without adequate rest, making it particularly prevalent among athletes, including runners.	T/T>C/C	The rs679620 AG genotype is associated with the typical likelihood of Achilles tendinopathy, as indicated by various studies (PMID(s): 19042922, 27222816, 28358823), while individuals with the GG genotype face a heightened risk for Achilles tendinopathy. In cases of Achilles tendon rupture (RUP), the MMP3 rs679620 GG genotype is notably more prevalent (44.0%) compared to controls (19.1%), where the AG genotype is more common (54.2%) (PMID: 19042922). Another study, albeit relatively small (~100 patients), found associations between Achilles tendinopathy risk and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MMP3 gene. For rs679620,  they found individuals with the (G;G) genotype exhibited an odds ratio of 2.5 (CI: 1.2 - 4.90, p = 0.010). Moreover, there's evidence of an interaction between rs679620(G) and COL5A1 rs12722(T) alleles, contributing to an increased risk for Achilles tendinopathy with a p-value of 0.006.	Homozygous
Metabolic Syndrome	Metabolism	APOA5	rs662799	Metabolic syndrome is a term used to describe a cluster of risk factors that elevate the likelihood of developing heart disease and other health issues, including diabetes and stroke. The term ""metabolic"" refers to the biochemical processes integral to the body's normal functioning. Risk factors encompass traits, conditions, or habits that increase the probability of disease development. In this context, ""heart disease"" primarily refers to coronary heart disease (CHD), wherein plaque, a waxy substance, accumulates inside the coronary arteries, leading to their hardening and narrowing. This process reduces blood flow to the heart muscle, potentially causing chest pain, heart attacks, cardiac damage, or even death. For more information, you can visit the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; National Institutes of Health; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/metabolic-syndrome.	G/G>A/A	rs662799 (G-A, or C-T) is a SNP in the APOA5 gene.The rarer rs662799(G or C) allele has been associated in multiple other reports to be associated with higher triglyceride levels. The rs662799 AA/TT genotype has been associated with an average likelihood of metabolic syndrome, according to a study (PMID: 23468858). In summary for other studies, The G allele is considered the minor allele and has several associations: each G allele is linked to higher triglyceride levels; the AG genotype is associated with a 1.4 times higher risk of early heart attacks and less weight gain on high-fat diets; while the GG genotype is associated with a 2 times higher risk of early heart attacks and also less weight gain on high-fat diets.	Homozygous
Height	Physical Appearance	HMGA2	rs1042725	Height is the measurement of the length from the floor to the top of an individual's head when standing upright. This measurement is expressed in inches, feet, centimeters, or meters and tends to remain relatively stable throughout adulthood until later stages of life. Both genetic and environmental factors, including nutrition and exercise, play roles in influencing an individual's height. Specific genetic variations have been identified in association with the final height achieved by an individual.	C/C>C/T	The rs1042725 TT genotype has been associated with average height, based on studies (PMID(s): 19139030, 17767157, 19930247, 21921580, 26536448) while CC genotype indicates- ~0.8cm taller height; CT genotype indicates ~0.4cm taller height. SNP rs1042725 is associated with height (P = 4E-8) in a study involving over 20,000 individuals. The gene harboring this SNP, HMGA2, is a strong biological candidate for having an influence on height, since rare, severe mutations in this gene are known to alter body size in mice and humans.rs1042725 is estimated to explain approx 0.3% of population variation in height in both adults and children (approx 0.4 cm increased adult height per C allele).[PMID 19139030] rs1042725 is associated with increased height (0.36 cm 95% IC[0.12-0.61] per C allele, P=0.004). in men rs1042725 may explain 3% of height variability.

Finger Length Ratio	Physical Appearance	SMOC1	rs2332175	Finger length is commonly measured from the point where the finger joins the hand to the tip of the finger. The finger length ratio, often denoted as 2D:4D, represents the ratio of the lengths of the index and ring fingers. This ratio is calculated by dividing the length of the index finger on one hand by the length of the ring finger on the same hand. Evidence suggests that the 2D:4D ratio may correlate with certain human characteristics, such as increased reproductive success or a reduced risk of video game addiction. These correlations vary between males and females, with the differences thought to result from in utero exposure to hormones.In general, 2D:4D is higher in females (M = 0.979 SD = 0.030) than in males (M = 0.964, SD = 0.031); this difference was highly significant [t(977) = _7.3, P = 6.48 _ 10_13].More men than women have shorter index fingers than ring fingers, resulting in a lower 2D:4D ratio. Therefore, a lower 2D:4D ratio is indicative of a more masculine hormonal profile or environment during fetal development. These differences are influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.	G/G>A/A	The rs2332175 AA genotype is reported to be associated with the typical difference in length between the 2nd and 4th fingers, as indicated by a study (PMID: 23263445). Each additional copy of the G allele was associated with a 0.0074 decrease in 2D:4D(P value 3.44 _ 10_8).	Homozygous

Higher melanin levels are linked to darker hues, while lower levels are associated with lighter tones. Melanin also contributes to the formation of freckles, characterized by brown spots resulting from sun exposure. The synthesis of melanin involves a complex pathway influenced by various environmental factors, including UV rays, alongside genetic factors.	G/G>G/T	Studies in Europeans show that the rs12896399 GG genotype is associated with a typical likelihood of having blue eyes and blond hair and TT genotype is associated with lighter hair color and more likelyhood of blue eyes (PMID: 17952075).	Heterozygous
Pigmentation	Physical Appearance	OCA2	rs4778138	Pigmentation refers to the coloring of skin, eyes, hair, and nails, with melanocytes responsible for producing melanin?he primary pigment influencing coloration.

Melanin also contributes to the formation of freckles, characterized by brown spots resulting from sun exposure. The synthesis of melanin involves a complex pathway influenced by various environmental factors, including UV rays, alongside genetic factors.	A/A>A/G	The rs4778138 TT genotype is linked to blue eye color, heightened freckling, and a greater number of moles in comparison to individuals with brown eyes (PMID: 17236130). Other genptypes are assoicated with brwon eyes and darker skin.	Heterozygous
Eye Color	Physical Appearance	HERC2	rs12913832	Eye colors are determined by the variable pigmentation of the iris and the scattering of light by the iris. Individuals with a higher concentration of the dark pigment melanin tend to have darker eye colors, while those with a lower concentration generally have lighter-colored eyes.

Nearsightedness(myopia)	Sensory Perception	Intergenic	rs560766	Nearsightedness, also known as myopia or short-sightedness, is a condition characterized by a mismatch between the focusing power of the eye and the length of the eye. In nearsightedness, light rays are focused in front of the retina rather than directly on it. Individuals with nearsightedness may experience difficulty seeing objects that are far away, while maintaining the ability to focus on close objects.	G/G>G/A	The rs560766 AA genotype has been associated with increased odds of being nearsighted, according to studies (PMID(s): 20835239, 23131718, 22665138)*,compared to AG or GG genotype.

Lumbar Disc Disease Susceptibility	Athleticism	CILP	rs2073711	Lumbar disc disease is a term commonly used to encompass various causes of back pain or sciatica. While muscle strain or ligament sprain can contribute to low back pain (LBP), the intervertebral disc is often implicated more frequently as a source of discomfort. However, it's essential to note that no single lumbar disc injury has been definitively identified as the sole cause of pain associated with lumbar disc disease.	A/A>G/G	In summary, the rs2073711 CC genotype has been associated with a typical risk of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVD), while CT and TT are representing lower risk of Lumbar Disk Disease.The rs2073711 SNP (1184T_C ) is located in exon 8 of the cartilage intermediate layer protein gene (CILP). However, CILP gene is primarily known to be expressed abundantly in intervertebral discs, and was reported to have increased expression when degeneration occurs [PMID 15864306]. For the rs2073711 SNP, the ancestral allele is T and the disease associated risk allele is C. A study of Asian patients with lumbar disc disease (LDD) implicates each copy of a (C) allele of SNP rs2073711 (as oriented with respect to dbSNP) as increasing risk about 1.6 fold. [PMID 15864306].

Caffeine Metabolism	Wellness	CYP1A2	rs762551	Caffeine, a bitter substance, naturally occurs in over 60 plants, including coffee beans, tea leaves, kola nuts (used to flavor colas), and cacao pods (utilized in chocolate production). Synthetic caffeine is also artificially created and added to certain medicines, foods, and beverages. Examples include pain relievers, cold medicines, over-the-counter alertness medications, energy drinks, as well as energy-boosting gums and snacks.The primary sources of caffeine consumption are beverages, with varying caffeine content in different drinks. Generally, the caffeine amounts are as follows: 8-ounce cup of coffee = 95-200 mg, 12-ounce can of cola = 35-45 mg, 8-ounce energy drink = 70-100 mg, 8-ounce cup of tea = 14-60 mg. Caffeine affects the body's metabolism in various ways; it stimulates the central nervous system, providing a feeling of wakefulness and energy boost. Caffeine acts as a diuretic, promoting the elimination of excess salt and water through increased urination. It also enhances stomach acid release, potentially causing upset stomach or heartburn. Moreover, caffeine may impact calcium absorption and elevate blood pressure.Upon consumption, caffeine reaches its peak level in the bloodstream within one hour, with effects lasting for four to six hours. For more detailed information, you can visit https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html#summary.	C/C>C/A	A meta-analysis conducted by Denden et al. showed that the rs762551 AA genotype is associated with higher coffee intake and faster caffeine clearance than CC and CA genotype. CA genotype is associated with a slightly faster rate of caffeine metabolism than CC genptype (PMID(s): 29282363, 20390257,27173183).	Heterozygous
Nicotine Response	Substance Reaction	CHRNA3	rs1051730	Nicotine is a naturally occurring compound found in the tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum, and is present in tobacco products like cigarettes, dip, and chew. Its high addictiveness is attributed to its interaction with receptors in the brain, leading to the release of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, associated with pleasurable feelings. The response to nicotine exposure is influenced by specific genetic factors, which can impact susceptibility to addiction.	G/G>G/A	The rs1051730 GA genotype has been associated with an increased quantity of cigarettes smoked per day among smokers, as reported in studies (PMID(s): 18385739, 19247474, 19132693, 20418890, 27127891)*.TT genotype is associated with increased risk of lung cancer; reduced response to alcohol, therefore possibly increased risk of alcohol abusers1051730, also known as D398N, is a SNP in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 3 subunit CHRNA3 gene.In two recent (2008) studies, together comprising over 6,000 lung cancer patients of European ancestry, the rs1051730(T) allele was very significantly associated with increased risk. Having one copy (i.e. being a rs1051730(CT) genotype) increased risk for lung cancer about 1.3x, and having two copies (rs1051730(T;T) individuals) represented 1.8x increased risk. Up to 14% of lung cancer incidence may be attributable to this allele.[PMID 18385738, PMID 18385676]An independent study published at the same time concluded that (T) allele carriers for SNP rs1051730 are not at higher risk of becoming smokers compared to (C) carriers. However, if they do smoke, (T) carriers are quite likely to smoke more cigarettes than (C) carriers, and as an apparent consequence, they are at higher risk for lung cancer as reported in this and other studies. This study therefore links rs1051730 directly to nicotine dependence, and indirectly to lung cancer.

Male Pattern Baldness	Physical Appearance	SLC14A2	rs8085664	Male Pattern Baldness is characterized by hair loss that occurs when the hair follicle starts to shrink and continues to do so over time. This loss is attributed to an interaction between specific genetic factors and the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The hair loss follows a well-defined pattern, typically starting above both temples. As the hair follicle continues to shrink, the affected hair becomes shorter and finer, ultimately leading to a lack of new hair growth in the affected areas.

Longevity	Longevity	FOXO3	rs2764264	Longevity is a complex trait influenced by numerous factors, exhibiting significant variability between individuals. The aging process can manifest differently, with some individuals showing signs of aging, such as extensive skin wrinkles, completely gray hair, loss of muscle tone, and reduced mobility, in their 60s. In contrast, others may maintain a more youthful appearance well into their 90s or even close to 100 years of age. This diversity in aging patterns is attributed to the interplay of genetic and environmental factors, both of which contribute significantly to the observed variability in the aging process.

Caffeine Metabolism	Wellness	Near AHR	rs4410790	Caffeine, a bitter substance, naturally occurs in over 60 plants, including coffee beans, tea leaves, kola nuts (used to flavor colas), and cacao pods (utilized in chocolate production). Synthetic caffeine is also artificially created and added to certain medicines, foods, and beverages. Examples include pain relievers, cold medicines, over-the-counter alertness medications, energy drinks, as well as energy-boosting gums and snacks.The primary sources of caffeine consumption are beverages, with varying caffeine content in different drinks. Generally, the caffeine amounts are as follows: 8-ounce cup of coffee = 95-200 mg, 12-ounce can of cola = 35-45 mg, 8-ounce energy drink = 70-100 mg, 8-ounce cup of tea = 14-60 mg. Caffeine affects the body's metabolism in various ways; it stimulates the central nervous system, providing a feeling of wakefulness and energy boost. Caffeine acts as a diuretic, promoting the elimination of excess salt and water through increased urination. It also enhances stomach acid release, potentially causing upset stomach or heartburn. Moreover, caffeine may impact calcium absorption and elevate blood pressure.Upon consumption, caffeine reaches its peak level in the bloodstream within one hour, with effects lasting for four to six hours. For more detailed information, you can visit https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html#summary.	T/T>C/C	The C allele is linked to lower levels of caffeine intake. Individuals with the TT genotype tend to consume about one-third more coffee per day compared to those with the CT or CC genotypes. A genome-wide meta-analysis has pinpointed regions on chromosomes 7p21 (AHR) and 15q24 (CYP1A2) as key determinants of habitual caffeine consumption. The AHR protein enhances the production of enzymes CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, responsible for metabolizing caffeine. This finding is supported by research indicating associations between genetic variations in the AHR and CYP1A1-CYP1A2 gene regions and habitual caffeine consumption.	Homozygous

Ligament Injury Susceptibility	Athleticism	COL1A1	rs1800012	A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone. Ligament injuries, often involving the knee, are common. The knee has several ligaments, each serving a specific function. The Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) runs along the inside of the knee, preventing it from bending inward, while the Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL) runs along the outside, preventing excessive outward bending. The Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL), located in the middle, helps prevent the shin bone from sliding forward. The Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) complements the ACL by preventing the shin bone from sliding backward under the thigh bone. Injuries to these ligaments can range from stretching to partial or complete tears, leading to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and a sensation of the knee ""giving out"" when pressure is applied.	C/C	Research involving individuals of European ancestry suggests that the rs1800012 GG genotype is associated with an average likelihood of tendon and/or ligament injuries, and rs1800012 GT/TT polymorphism may be associated with the reduced risk of sports-related tendon or ligament injuries(PMID: 28206959).rs1800012 represents a common (allele frequency ~20%) polymorphism consisting of a G-to-T substitution at the first base of a consensus site for the transcription factor Sp1 in the first intron of the COL1A1 gene. COL1A1 rs1800012 polymorphism (G-to-T) may be associated with the reduced risk of sports-related tendon or ligament injuries, especially in ACL injuries, and that rare TT may played as a protective role.The rs1800012(T) allele has been extensively studied, with most observations supporting at least some association with decreased bone mineral density, and increased risk for osteoporosis, fractures, and intervertebral disc disease.	homo_ref
Muscle Strength	Athleticism	ACVR1B	rs2854464	Muscle strength is defined as the maximum amount of force that a group of muscles (such as biceps, triceps, quadriceps, etc.) can apply to an object simultaneously.

Thus, the AA genotype is associated with increased knee muscle strength, specifically higher dynamic knee flexion and extension strength (PMID: 21063444). In this study,a relatively large cohort of athletes from Europe and South America have shown that the ACVR1B rs2854464 A allele is associated with sprint/power performance in Caucasians but not in Brazilian athletes.

Muscular Endurance	Athleticism	PPARA	rs4253778	Muscular endurance refers to the ability of muscles to exert strength over an extended period at a submaximal (less than the maximum) capacity. Sports that demand endurance often involve activities such as cycling, swimming, long-distance running, triathlons, and cross-country skiing.	G/G	The rs4253778 GG genotype and G allele has been associated with increased performance in endurance sports, as reported in a study (PMID: 26985127)*, compared to CC genotype.Note:Further studies recruiting athletes that represented different sports disciplines have revealed that it was more likely to find C allele carriers in a group of power-oriented athletes who were involved in short and very intense anaerobic effort (Ahmetov et al., 2006), while GG homozygotes were more prevalent among endurance-type athletes performing predominantly prolonged aerobic exertion (Eynon et al., 2010; Maciejewska et al., 2011). Gineviciene et al.

Menopause Age	Hormones	MCM8	rs16991615	Menopause refers to the cessation of a woman's menstrual cycle, indicating the end of her reproductive capability. This natural biological process also signifies the conclusion of her ability to conceive children. Menopause involves significant hormonal changes, leading to symptoms like hot flashes and mood alterations. The onset of menopause is typically recognized when there has been a 12-month span without menstruation. In the United States, the average age of menopause is around 51 years, though individual variations exist. Factors influencing the timing of menopause include natural hormonal variations, medical conditions or treatments affecting hormone production, and surgical interventions like the removal of the ovaries, a key source of female sex hormones. Additionally, genetic variations play a role in determining the age at which menopause occurs.	G/G	The rs16991615 GG genotype has been associated with the typical age of menopause onset, according to studies (PMID(s): 20952801, 23508249, 23592221, 19448621).The AA genotype is associated with menopause increased by avg of 22 months and AG genotype is slight increase (11 months) in avg age at menopause.rs16991615 is a nonsynonymous SNP on chromosome 20.A case control study of ~2,000 women found that each rs16991615(A) allele was associated with an average increase in age at menopause of 11 months. This also meant that each rs16991615(G) allele yielded an odds ratio of 1.85 (CI: 1.51?.2, p = 1.45 x 10e-9) of early menopause, defined as occurring before the age of 46.[PMID 20952801].Overall, women homozygous for the ""early"" alleles at all 4 SNPs found in this study were ~4 times more likely to undergo menopause early compared to women who had a total of 3 or less risk alleles. 	homo_ref

Polyunsaturated Fats	Nutrition and Diet	FADS1	rs174547	This type of fat, known as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), remains in a liquid state at room temperature. Two main categories of PUFAs are omega-6 and omega-3. Omega-6 fatty acids are present in liquid vegetable oils like corn oil, safflower oil, and soybean oil. On the other hand, omega-3 fatty acids are derived from plant sources such as canola oil, flaxseed, soybean oil, and walnuts, as well as from seafood, including fatty fish (e.g., salmon, tuna, trout) and shellfish (e.g., crab, mussels, oysters). Specific omega-3 fatty acids like EPA and DHA are abundant in seafood, while another type, ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), is found in various foods, including some vegetable oils like canola and soy. Omega-3s are also available in dietary supplements, with fish oil supplements containing EPA and DHA, and flaxseed oil supplements containing ALA. While there is moderate evidence supporting the health benefits of consuming seafood, the health advantages of omega-3 dietary supplements remain unclear (Source: National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health; National Institutes of Health; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services).

Another study ([PMID 24048645]) has concluded that almost individuals carrying the A111T variant can trace ancestry back to a single person who most likely lived at least 10,000 years ago.This SNP is one of three from the SLC24A5 gene that can be analyzed to categorize the ancestry of a person as either West Eurasian (Middle Eastern, Caucasian, European, etc.), African, or East Eurasian, based on a 2009 study.[PMID 19440451]	homo_ref
Taste Preference and Perception: bitter taste	Sensory Perception	TAS2R38	rs713598	The perception of ""bitterness"" is inherent in our taste buds. Compounds like the phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) molecule and its counterparts are recognized for their bitter taste and can be present in various foods, including coffee, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts. The sensitivity of our taste bud receptors to these compounds is influenced by a combination of environmental and genetic factors.	C/C	rs713598 is one of three SNPs that form the main haplotypes behind the ability to perceive as bitter the taste of the compound phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and similar molecules in foods (like cabbage and raw broccoli) or drinks (like coffee and dark beers).Due to it's minus orientation and nearly 50/50 split of allele frequency it is easily confused.In the orientation shown in dbSNP and used in SNPedia, rs713598(G) is the ""non-tasting"" allele,rs713598(C) is the ""tasting"" allele.In the GRCh37 orientation currently (2017) reported by 23andMe, rs713598(C) is the ""non-tasting"" allele rs713598(G) is the ""tasting"" allele. Tasting is dominant, so heterozygotes are able to taste bitterness.If you are a ""taster"", you're also likely to carry at least one rs10246939(C) and one rs1726866(C) allele since, along with rs713598(G), these three SNPs form the most common tasting haplotype. If you lack these alleles, you're quite likely (~80%) to be a non-taster of bitterness, meaning that foods that may taste bitter to others taste far less bitter to you.[PMID 12595690]	homo_ref
Nearsightedness(myopia)	Sensory Perception	Intergenic	rs10034228	Nearsightedness, also known as myopia or short-sightedness, is a condition characterized by a mismatch between the focusing power of the eye and the length of the eye. In nearsightedness, light rays are focused in front of the retina rather than directly on it. Individuals with nearsightedness may experience difficulty seeing objects that are far away, while maintaining the ability to focus on close objects.	T/T	The rs10034228 TT genotype has been found to be associated with a typical risk of high-grade myopia in the Chinese population, as reported in studies (PMID(s): 21505071, 22150588).Specifically, the T allele at this locus was found to have a protective effect against high myopia. Individuals carrying the C/C genotype at rs10034228 were found to have a higher risk of high myopia compared to those with the T allele.	homo_ref
Odor detection	Sensory Perception	Intergenic	rs1953558	The ability to smell is attributed to olfactory receptors located in the nasal cavity. These receptors interact with airborne molecules, and the olfactory nerves connected to them transmit signals to the brain, which interprets the scent. While each individual has a unique perception of scents, genetic factors play a role in determining the ability to detect specific molecules.	T/T	The rs1953558 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located within the human OR11H7 gene, which encodes for an olfactory receptor. This receptor is involved in the sense of smell and can influence an individual's sensitivity to specific odors. Specifically, the rs1953558 SNP has been associated with the perception of isovaleric acid, a chemical compound commonly associated with the smell of sweat, particularly the odor of feet.According to the search results provided, individuals with the TT genotype at the rs1953558 locus exhibit a slightly reduced sensitivity to the smell of isovaleric acid. This means that these individuals may require a higher concentration of isovaleric acid to detect the odor compared to those with other genotypes. In contrast, individuals with the TC or CC genotypes may have a heightened sensitivity to this odorant.The variation in olfactory sensitivity linked to the rs1953558 SNP is part of a broader pattern of genetic diversity in human olfaction. It is estimated that there is about a 30% difference in olfactory receptors among individuals, which can explain why some people can detect certain smells while others cannot.

Asparagus Odor Detection	Sensory Perception	Near OR2M7	rs4481887	Asparagus contains a unique compound called asparagusic acid, believed to be responsible for the distinctive scent in urine after its consumption, along with its sulfur-containing metabolites. However, not everyone can perceive this odor. Research indicates variations among individuals in the production of these odorous compounds and their ability to detect the scent. Anosmia, the loss of the sense of smell, is often referred to as 'asparagus anosmia' when describing the inability to detect these compounds in urine. Genetic changes have been identified as factors linked to the ability to perceive the scent of asparagus urine.	A/A	Studies involving people of European ancestry suggest that individuals with the rs4481887 AG genotype are more adept at detecting the scent of asparagus in urine, reducing the chances of experiencing asparagus anosmia (PMID(s): 20585627, 20876394, 27965198). Those with the AA genotype are the most likely to detect the scent of asparagus metabolites in urine, while those with the GG genotype are the least likely to perceive it.	homo_ref
Alcohol Flush	Wellness	ALDH2	rs671	Alcohol sensitivity, also recognized as alcohol flush reaction or alcohol intolerance, is associated with the body's capacity to metabolize alcohol. This response commonly manifests as facial flushing (reddening of the face), heart palpitations (rapid, irregular, or fluttering heartbeat), lightheadedness, and nausea. These symptoms arise mainly from the accumulation of acetaldehyde, a byproduct formed when the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase fails to convert ethanol (alcohol) into acetate at an adequate pace. There are identifiable genetic variations that play a role in influencing alcohol sensitivity.	G/G	AA: Commonly referred to as ""Asian Flushers,"" individuals with this genotype have an increased risk of esophageal cancer, particularly those of East Asian ancestry. Disulfiram, a medication used to treat alcoholism, is usually not effective for individuals with this genotype.AG: Individuals with this genotype also experience the Asian Flush phenomenon and may have worse hangovers. They share an increased risk of esophageal cancer, especially among those of East Asian ancestry. Disulfiram is also likely ineffective for treating alcoholism in individuals with this genotype.GG: Individuals with this genotype do not typically experience the alcohol flush reaction. They have normal hangovers and are at average risk for alcoholism and esophageal cancer. Disulfiram is considered effective for treating alcoholism in individuals with this genotype.	homo_ref
Caffeine Metabolism	Wellness	Near CYP1A2	rs2472297	Caffeine, a bitter substance, naturally occurs in over 60 plants, including coffee beans, tea leaves, kola nuts (used to flavor colas), and cacao pods (utilized in chocolate production). Synthetic caffeine is also artificially created and added to certain medicines, foods, and beverages. Examples include pain relievers, cold medicines, over-the-counter alertness medications, energy drinks, as well as energy-boosting gums and snacks.The primary sources of caffeine consumption are beverages, with varying caffeine content in different drinks. Generally, the caffeine amounts are as follows: 8-ounce cup of coffee = 95-200 mg, 12-ounce can of cola = 35-45 mg, 8-ounce energy drink = 70-100 mg, 8-ounce cup of tea = 14-60 mg. Caffeine affects the body's metabolism in various ways; it stimulates the central nervous system, providing a feeling of wakefulness and energy boost. Caffeine acts as a diuretic, promoting the elimination of excess salt and water through increased urination. It also enhances stomach acid release, potentially causing upset stomach or heartburn. Moreover, caffeine may impact calcium absorption and elevate blood pressure.Upon consumption, caffeine reaches its peak level in the bloodstream within one hour, with effects lasting for four to six hours. For more detailed information, you can visit https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html#summary.	C/C	The rs2472297 CC genotype has been associated with average daily coffee consumption, as indicated by studies (PMID(s): 21357676, 21876539, 25288136).A meta-analysis of four GWAS studies of coffee consumption among a total of ~8,000 coffee drinkers of European ancestry found that the?s2472297(T) was strongly associated with increased consumption (p = 5.4 x 10e-14). The estimated effect was an increase of 0.2 cups a day per allele for both this SNP and one other (rs6968865).[PMID 21357676].

Deep Sleep	Wellness	ADA	rs73598374	Deep sleep, also called slow-wave sleep,?ccurs in the third stage of?on-rapid eye movement?NREM) sleep. During deep sleep, electrical activity in the brain appears in long, slow waves called delta waves. These waves have a frequency of 0.5 to 2 Hertz.Research studies have identified a variation in the ADA gene, revealing its influence on deep sleep. The ADA gene, responsible for producing the adenosine deaminase enzyme, plays a crucial role in breaking down adenosine? molecule central to the regulation of various physiological processes. Alterations in the ADA gene correlate with a diminished conversion of adenosine, potentially resulting in an accumulation of adenosine and heightened fatigue. This insight underscores the significance of genetic factors in shaping the intricacies of deep sleep and its impact on overall physiological well-being.	C/C	The rs73598374 polymorphism with T allele leading to decreased adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity due to an amino acid substitution, has been extensively studied regarding its impact on sleep patterns and cognitive functions in humans. ADA enzyme is vital in the metabolic pathway of adenosine, a key regulator of sleep and arousal. A study (PMID: 21734253) highlights that this functional ADA polymorphism, particularly the T allele (TT genotype) of rs73598374, results in reduced ADA activity due to an amino acid substitution, and is associated with deeper sleep and decreased vigilant attention. Consequently, individuals carrying the T allele may experience more profound sleep phases and might find it challenging to sustain alertness during specific tasks.	homo_ref
Lactose Intolerance	Wellness	MCM6	rs4988235	Lactose intolerance refers to an impaired ability to digest lactose, a sugar present in milk and other dairy products. In infancy, lactose is typically broken down by an enzyme called lactase, produced by cells in the lining of the small intestine. However, the production of this enzyme ceases during or after weaning, and most adult mammals, including humans, become unable to efficiently digest lactose. Primary lactase deficiency, also known as lactase nonpersistence, is the most prevalent type of lactase deficiency.	G/G	The rs4988235 CC genotype is associated with lactose intolerance in adults.Individuals with the CC genotype at the rs4988235 SNP are typically unable to continue producing lactase into adulthood, leading to lactose intolerance. This intolerance manifests as gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain following the consumption of dairy products due to the undigested lactose fermenting in the gut.On the other hand, individuals with the CT or TT genotypes are more likely to continue producing lactase throughout their lives, allowing them to digest milk and other dairy products without adverse effects. The TT genotype is associated with a higher likelihood of being able to digest milk in adulthood compared to the CT genotype.	homo_ref

G/G	First discovered in 2004, rs34637584 is a SNP indicating a position within the LRRK2 that encodes a variant protein. This SNP is commonly referred to as the G2019S variant (or, mutation) based on the potential change from glycine (encoded by rs34637584(G) allele) to serine (encoded by the rs34637584(A) allele) at position 2019 of the LRRK2 protein.[PMID 15680456][PMID 15680455]One copy of a rs34637584(A) allele is sufficient to greatly increase one's risk for Parkinson's disease(refer to GA and AA genotype).
